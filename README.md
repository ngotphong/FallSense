# FallSense

**FallSense** is an open-source AI application with a sleek UI, powered by a fine-tuned YOLOv7 model (PyTorch) for real-time stroke and fall detection. Designed for monitoring elderly patients and individuals at risk, FallSense provides instant alerts, automatic video recording, and actionable analytics to help caregivers and medical professionals respond quickly and effectively.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Real-Time Stroke & Fall Detection

- Utilizes a state-of-the-art YOLOv7 model, fine-tuned on real CCTV footage for robust detection of sudden strokes and falls.
- Fast, accurate, and reliable—works with live camera feeds or video files.

Live Camera feature

### 2. Automatic Event Recorder

- Instantly records and saves video clips when a fall or stroke is detected.
- Footage is stored locally for later review, medical analysis, or model retraining.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. **Prepare Environment**

- Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- Create a new virtual environment:
  ```sh
  conda create -n fallsense python=3.11.10
  conda activate fallsense
  ```

### 2. **Clone the Repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ngotphong/fall-detection.git
cd fall-detection
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. **Download Model Weights**

- Download the fine-tuned YOLOv7 weights from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/ngotphong/FallSense/tree/main)
- Place the file in the `weights/` directory:
  ```
  weights/
    └── fall_detection_person.pt
  ```

### 5. **Run FallSense**

```sh
python Main_Gui.py
```
